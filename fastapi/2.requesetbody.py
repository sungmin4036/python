#   With just that Python type declaration, FastAPI will:

# Read the body of the request as JSON.
# Convert the corresponding types (if needed).
# Validate the data.
# If the data is invalid, it will return a nice and clear error, indicating exactly where and what was the incorrect data.
# Give you the received data in the parameter item.
# As you declared it in the function to be of type Item, you will also have all the editor support (completion, etc) for all of the attributes and their types.
# Generate JSON Schema definitions for your model, you can also use them anywhere else you like if it makes sense for your project.
# Those schemas will be part of the generated OpenAPI schema, and used by the automatic documentation UIs.
